  "aboutMe": "I'm Genos, a frontend engineer who loves weight training.",
  "aboutMe-F2E": "I mainly write Vue3, Nuxt3, and a little bit of Next.js. I'm not as familiar with Vue as I am with React, but I've written various front-stage and back-stage projects, from scratch, maintenance, to refactoring.",
  "aboutMe-Workout": "In the past few years, I mainly focused on four exercises (squat, bench press, deadlift, and military press). Starting from 2024, I began to learn weight-lifting.",
  "aboutMe-summarize": "There are too many things to learn in frontend and weight training. Every little breakthrough is a moment worth commemorating.",
